# LIGN167_Final_Project_WI22
LIGN167 Final Project
Topic: Hate Speech Classification
Team members: Allen Cheung, Beibei Du, Kaiyuan Wang

## Jump Start 
- Fine-tune on twitter datset for 10 epochs (approx. 1 min per epoch)

  ```python main.py --dataset twitter --save --epoch 10```

- Force a git pull on datahub (WARNING: All changes on datahub will be overwritten):
  ```
  git fetch --all
  git branch backup-master
  git reset --hard origin/main
  ```

## Repo Structure (After running ```prepare_datasets.sh```)

- get_data.sh
- datasets
    - [parler_pretrain.ndjson](./datasets/parler_pretrain.ndjson) (**Parler** dataset for pre-training)
    - [gab.csv](./datasets/gab.csv) (**Gab** dataset for fine-tune training and testing)
    - [twitter.csv](./datasets/twitter.csv) (**Twitter** dataset for fine-tune training and testing)
    - [Reddit.csv](./datasets/reddit.csv) (**Reddit** dataset for fine-tune training and testing)


## Use GPU Cluster (UCSD DataHub)
- Step1: Go to [DataHub Website](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/spawn)
- Step2: Select the env with GPU ( Python 3, nbgrader (1 GPU, 8 CPU, 16G RAM) )
- Step3: Click "Launch Environment"
- Step4: On the top right corner, click "New". In drop-down menu, click "Terminal"
  - This should spawn a bash terminal
- Step5: Clone project repo in the new terminal, by running: 

  ```https://github.com/belladu0201/LIGN167_Final_Project_WI22.git```

  **NOTE**: GitHub now requires personal access token for ssh authentication. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for how to create the token.
- Step6: (Only after the first clone) Download dataset by running: 
  
  ```cd ~/LIGN167_Final_Project_WI22/ && bash get_data.sh```

- Step7: Switich to the desired branch by running: 
  
  ```git checkout <branch_name>```

2. [Hate Speech from **Twitter**](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language), Davidson et. al. The data are stored as a CSV and as a pickled pandas dataframe (Python 2.7). Each data file contains 5 columns:
    - `count` = number of CrowdFlower users who coded each tweet (min is 3, sometimes more users coded a tweet when judgments were determined to be unreliable by CF).

    - `hate_speech` = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be hate speech.

    - `offensive_language` = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be offensive.

    - `neither` = number of CF users who judged the tweet to be neither offensive nor non-offensive.

    - **`class`** = class label for majority of CF users.
      0 - hate speech
      1 - offensive  language
      2 - neither
